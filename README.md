Hello! Anybody who is reading this, I really appreciate you taking the time to check out my DIY Dev Project. This is my first real-world project in my journey to become a Full-Stack Developer. I'm 25 years old as of Aug 22, I decided to make a change in my lifestyle and career path. My grandfather died in the year of 2017, He was a traveling salesman his entire life. He traveled the world and experienced many different wonders of the world including, the Grand Canyon.

Now, at this time I was working for Nissan as a Car Salesman. The job was pretty interesting, however, I felt as though something was not right. I would get this feeling of Monotony every time I hit "Clock-in." I aspired to be my Grandfather one day, respecting him for success and wisdom passed unto me. He would always say, "Everything in life happens for a reason, make sure you're not wasting your time finding out what that reason is." I took his passing as a sign that being a salesman, was a waste of time. I decided to pursure the vast, no, MASSIVE world of IT...

This is my first fully-responsive website inspired by John Smilga (Udemy Instructor). This project features basic semantic format for HTML5, transitions, animations and so much more. I'm inspired so much, that I'm ready to move onto the next one!
